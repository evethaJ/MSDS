# Final Project 1: NYPD Shooting Incident Severity Analysis
In this report I correlate the severity of NYPD Shooting Incident(Fatal, Non-fatal) with administrative unit(Borough) and victim's demographics(Age, Sex and Race). NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) contains a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity.
